# **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using Evolutionary Algorithm and Deep Learning**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop an **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** system using a combination of **Evolutionary Algorithms** and **Deep Learning** techniques. ABSA focuses on identifying and categorizing sentiment not just at the document level but also at the **aspect level**, enabling a deeper understanding of the sentiment towards specific features or aspects of products, services, or entities in textual data.

The proposed solution leverages **Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)** to optimize feature selection and fine-tune deep learning models for sentiment analysis, achieving enhanced performance and accuracy in predicting sentiment for various aspects of a text.
